Description: Connecting disease gene expression signatures to
    compound-induced gene expression profiles is valuable for understanding
    drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) and applying an existing therapeutic to
    a new disease indication. RCSM is an R package for measuring those 
    connectivities. RCSM implemented seven methods that are reported in 
    published papers.
